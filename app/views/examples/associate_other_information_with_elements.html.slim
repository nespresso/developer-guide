  markdown:
    Sometimes, it's necessary to provide screenreader users with additional or other information than displayed on screen. There are different ways of doing this.

    - Use the `↓` and `↑` keys to browse through the elements
        - Are there differences between what you see and what you hear?
    - Is there a difference when jumping from element to element using `Tab` and `Shift-Tab`?

#conclusion aria-hidden="true"
  markdown:
    - The first link doesn't have any additional text associated
    - The second link has an `aria-label` attribute applied
        - It replaces the whole content of the element with the value of the attribute
    - The third link has an `aria-labelledby` attribute applied
        - It references another element (by ID) and replaces the whole content of the element with the content of the referenced element
    - The fourth link has an `aria-labelledby` and an `aria-label` attribute applied (in this exact sequence)
        - The `aria-labelledby` attribute has precedence over `aria-label`
    - The fifth link has an `aria-label` and an `aria-labelledby` attribute applied (in this exact sequence)
        - The `aria-labelledby` attribute still has precedence over `aria-label`, so the sequence of the attributes doesn't seem to be essential
    - The sixth link has an `aria-describedby` attribute applied
        - It references another element (by ID) and adds the whole content of the element to the content of the referenced element
        - **Notice:** this added content is only announced in focus mode!
    - The seventh link uses #{link_to 'visually hidden text', example_path('hidden_content')} to add a description
        - **Notice:** this added content is always announced (which means in both browse and focus mode)

    As you can see, it's a bit hard to predict when to use which method. More info here:
