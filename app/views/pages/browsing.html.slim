markdown:
  Look at the following tutorials to gain a first idea on how to control a screenreader.

  Each tutorial is very small and narrowed to the specific topic. This is to make the experience as easy and enjoyable as possible.

  After you have some experience with controlling a screenreader, you will be ready to check out bigger websites (which often times are not optimised for screenreaders and therefore are difficult to use).

  Make your way through all the links below. Make sure that you have fired up NVDA when opening them (start NVDA using `Ctrl + Option + N`), and you may want to have the Speech Viewer window open, too (in the NVDA menu, choose `(T)ools` â†’ `(S)peech viewer`).
