markdown:
  Each tutorial is very small and narrowed to the specific topic. This is to make the experience as easy and enjoyable as possible.

  After you have some experience with controlling a screenreader, you will be ready to check out bigger websites (which often times are not optimised for screenreaders and therefore are difficult to use).

  Make your way through all the links below. Make sure that you have fired up NVDA when opening them (start NVDA using `Ctrl + Option + N`), and you may want to have the Speech Viewer window open, too (in the NVDA menu, choose `(T)ools` â†’ `(S)peech viewer`).

  - **#{link_to 'Browsing an empty page', example_path('browsing_an_empty_page')}** - see what an empty page looks like to a screenreader
  - **#{link_to 'Browsing paragraphs', example_path('browsing_paragraphs')}** - browse paragraphs of different lengths
  - **#{link_to 'Block vs. inline', example_path('block_vs_inline')}** - experience the difference between block and inline content
  - **#{link_to 'Browsing lists', example_path('browsing_lists')}** - lists are announced differently to screenreaders than "bare" text content
  - **#{link_to 'Browsing headings', example_path('browsing_headings')}** - see why headings are very important things
  - **#{link_to 'Links in action', example_path('links_in_action')}** - the things which made the internet the internet
  - **#{link_to 'Layout tables', example_path('layout_tables')}** - they still aren't dead!
  - **#{link_to 'Browsing tables', example_path('browsing_tables')}** - experience how tables are linearised
  - **#{link_to 'Content flow', example_path('content_flow')}** - the sequence in the DOM matters!
  - **Hidden content <sup>to do</sup>** - how content can be hidden in different ways
