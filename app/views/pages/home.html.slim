      With this pragmatic guide you'll learn how to use a [screenreader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader) in only a few hours. It was **written specifically for web developers** who want to build [accessible websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Accessibility_Initiative), but it will be useful for anyone else interested in learning a screenreader. It's easy, we promise!

      ## Why this guide?

      My name is [Joshua](/pages/about_us), and **I am a sighted web developer**. I'm working for the foundation [Access for all](http://www.access-for-all.ch/), which targets to make the internet an accessible place. I already spent a lot of time learning how to create accessible websites, and I know this is not a trivial topic. So **I want to share my full knowledge with you** to make your life easier.

      Everything in this **guide is counter-checked by my blind co-workers** (#{link_to 'Daniele, Petra, and Gianfranco', page_path('about_us')}), who are very experienced accessibility consultants.

      ## What you will get

      You'll learn in a very pragmatic way many important things you need to know when creating accessible websites. We'll provide you with **sensible examples** that you can experiment with so you get a profound feeling about what's needed to make a website accessible.

      We'll **focus on screenreader usage**, as it covers the most important topics. Some other tools may be discussed, too.

      This guide is written in a **rather shorthand and technical language**, so good knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and commonly used browser technologies is assumed.

        We are providing our own opinions here, based on profound experience as users and developers. We don't claim them to be the "best" solutions (and certainly not the only ones). But we are sure they're of high value. Please keep this in mind while reading our guide.

        While general efforts are taken to make this guide accessible, it is written for "typical" web developers without impairments.
