      ## Why this guide?

      My name is #{link_to 'Joshua', page_path('about', anchor: 'joshua')}, and **I am a sighted web developer**. I'm working for the foundation [Access for all](http://www.access-for-all.ch/), which targets to make the internet an accessible place. I already spent a lot of time learning how to create accessible websites, and I know this is not a trivial topic. So **I want to share my full knowledge with you** to make your life easier.

      Everything in this **guide is counter-checked by my blind co-workers** (#{link_to 'Daniele', page_path('about', anchor: 'daniele')}, #{link_to 'Petra', page_path('about', anchor: 'petra')}, and #{link_to 'Gianfranco', page_path('about', anchor: 'petra')}), who are very experienced accessibility consultants.

      ## What you will get

      You'll learn in a very pragmatic way many important things you need to know when creating accessible websites. We'll provide you with **sensible examples** that you can experiment with so you get a profound feeling about what's needed to make a website accessible.

      We'll **focus on [screenreader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader) usage** (it's not that hard, you'll see), as it covers most of the important topics. Some other tools will be discussed, too, to give a fuller picture.

      This guide is written in a **rather shorthand and technical language**, so good knowledge of [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and commonly used browser technologies is assumed.

      ## Why bother?

      Why should anyone be interested to go the extra mile to provide accessible websites - beneath the fact that **14% of the world population** (TODO: reference?) suffers from some sort of disability or impairment?

      - **Law requirements:** many countries have concrete obligations about accessibility, for example (TODO: Links?) Switzerland, Germany, France, and the USA.
      - **Moral obligations:** for people with disabilities, the internet offers an incredible amount of new ways to communicate, work, and therefore live an autonomous life.
      - **Clean code:** Accessibility relies heavily on clean HTML code. This means that a website built with accessibility in mind always results in a high quality product.

      Don't be the next one of our customers who's asked by us: "Hmmm, so what was your front end web developer's profession again??"

      Create accessible websites, starting from the current day! It's not that hard, you'll see!
